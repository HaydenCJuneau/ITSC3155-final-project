<<<<<<< HEAD
  <p>Welcome to Sasank's Fruity Website! Ever see an orange and thought it looked too orange? Or saw a blueberry thought that it didn't quite earn the name BLUEberry? Ever wish it was possible to create a completely new fruit? Well now it is possible! It's all thanks to our founder Sasank Pagadala, inventor of a new gene splicing tech, that allows you to create any fruit you can imagine! Now you can create apples with your favorite sports team's logo! Or you can create a new rasberry fruit plate. A useful plate that is also an edible raspberry tasting fruit, so there are no dishes after supper, just go ahead and eat your entire plate! Literally!</p>
