# Sasank's Fruity Website
## Team fruit: Sasank, Yadhira, Safa, Gabriel, Micheal and Hayden
Imagine a future, where fruit isnt all the same. In the year 2030, a man named Sasank Pagadala has invented a new gene splicing method to create any fruit one could dream of. Want an apple with legs? He can do that. A banana with wings and a top hat? He can do that. 
<br />
And now, at `sasanksfruitywebsite.gov` a mere citizen like you can contribute your ideas to our fruit generation empire. Become part of something greater, and fruitier, than yourself.
